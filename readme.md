## Density Function Theory Program - kspy-gga
  The program **kspy-lda** showed how to implement a Mura-Knowles/Lebedev grid and use a LDA functional. This program implements a Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) based functional. The functional I used was the Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (1996) (PBE) functional. Additionally the PBE0 hybrid functional can be used.

### The Grid
  The grid is the same as **kspy-lda**. The radial grid is a Mura-Knowles radial grid [ME Mura and PJ Knowles 'Improved radial grids for quadrature in density-functional calculations' JCP 104, 9848 (1996); DOI:10.1063/1.471749](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.471749). The 'coarse' angular grid is of Lebedev orders (11, 15) for period 1 and period 2 respectively. This translates into 50 and 86 points respectively arranged on a spherical shell (VI Lebedev, and DN Laikov, Doklady Mathematics, 'A Quadrature formula for the sphere of the 131st algebraic order of accuracy' Vol. 59, No. 3, (1999)). There are various sources for this data given in the external links of the wikipedia article on Lebedev integration.  A pruning scheme is employed to systematically reduce the number of angular points in regions where dense angular quadrature is not necessary, such as near the nuclei where the charge density is approximately spherically symmetric and at long distance from the nucleus. The pruning scheme I employed was the Treutler-Aldrich scheme [O Treutler and R Ahlrich, 'Efficient molecular numerical integration schemes' JCP 102, 346 (1995); DOI:10.1063/1.469408](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.469408). The partitioning of the atomic centered grids to a molecular grid follows a Becke scheme after Stratmann [RE Stratmann, GE Scuseria and MJ Frisch, 'Achieving Linear scaling in exchange-correlation density functional quadratures' CPL 257, 3-4 (1996); DOI:10.1016/009-2614(96)00600-8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0009261496006008?via%3Dihub). Finally I have implemented a final radius adjustment during the partition (Becke suggests doing this) using the Bragg radius. A second 'close' grid is also included which is a (50, 75) radial and (29, 29) angular, the latter representing 302 points on each shell. The grid routines are in ks_grid.py.

### The HF Integrals
  To get the DFT SCF started we need an initial density. To do this I use a HF overlap matrix S, and an initial Fock matrix composed of the sum of the 1-electron kinetic and coulomb integrals (core Hamiltonian - T+V). This Fock is then orthogonalised (F<sup>'</sup>) as (S<sup>-0.5</sup>)<sup>T</sup>FS<sup>-0.5</sup>, eigensolve the resulting orthogonal Fock for orbital coefficients C orthogonal, transform back to atomic basis as S<sup>-0.5</sup>C<sup>'</sup>, use resulting ao coefficients to compute a density matrix D<sub>&mu;&nu;</sub> = c<sub>&mu;i</sub>c<sub>i&nu;</sub> where i is over occupied orbitals. This initial density can be used with initial Fock and 2-electron repulsion integrals to form the coulomb integral J and the exchange integral K. To get these integrals I've used a modified version of Harpy's Cython integral package *aello*. I've removed the angular and electric field integrals and additionally the 2-electron repulsions are returned as a tensor rather than a linear array. These are in ks_aello.pyx.

### Molecule and Basis Sets
  The molecule definition is contained in a *mol* object which is itself comprised of objects from an atom class. Each instance of the atom class contains the atom symbol, atomic number and the coordinates of the atom center (array[3]). The molecule is hard coded as H<sub>2</sub>O. The basis is contained in an *orb* object which is itself comprised of objects from a gaussian class. Each instance of the gaussian class contains the atom the Gaussian is centered on, the momentum(array[3]), the exponents (array[primatives]), the coefficients (array[primatives]), the normalisation (array[primatives]) and a copy of the atom center coordinates (array[3]). The momenta are given as s [0,0,0] px [1,0,0] py [0,1,0] and pz [0,0,1]. The basis used is a simple STO-3G so we only require s and p orbitals. The primatives exponent and coefficient values are hard-coded in the __main__ section. (I use the psi4 format of the basis sets from BSE which have some (small) differences from the nwchem format versions as used by eg pyscf. This might lead to numerical differences in values when using high precision).

### The Functional
  We are using the GGA (Generalized Gradient Approximation) with the PBE functional - defined [here](https://www.chem.uci.edu/~kieron/dft/pubs/PBE97.pdf). The functional has been implemented in a way that is compatible with **libxc**. That is to say the LDA energy is included and rather than the pure gradients a contracted version (&sigma;) are passed to the functional evaluator. &sigma; is defined as &Delta;&rho;<sub>i</sub>.&Delta;&rho;<sub>i</sub>, details are given in the **libxc** documentation (https://www.tddft.org/programs/libxc/manual/libxc-5.1.x/). The functional code and gradient evaluation routines are in ks_ggaf.py. The hybrid GGA-HF functional PBE0 can also be used, this defined as 0.25&epsilon;<sub>x</sub><sup>HF</sup> + 0.75&epsilon;<sub>x</sub><sup>PBE</sup> + &epsilon;<sub>c</sub><sup>PBE</sup>, further details are [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_functional). Change the value of *functional* at the start of the __main__ section of ks_main to either 'PBE' or 'PBE0'.

### The Density
  The density is determined by first evaluating each Gaussian orbital over the grid (&rho;<sub>g</sub>), then assembling those into a complete basis over the grid (&rho;<sub>b</sub> = &Sigma;&rho;<sub>g</sub>) and finally computing &rho; as the product  &rho;<sub>b</sub>*&rho;<sub>b</sub>D. 

### Convergence
  The diis scheme is taken from harpy (diis.py) with some minor changes. This is implemented as a class in ks_util.

### Test
  The python code for the functional used here was copied into a pyscf eval_xc subroutine (user defined functional) and run with the same grid. The pyscf value is -75.225640018244 Hartree <sup>*</sup>, this agrees better than the convergence criteria of 1e-6. The value using libxc from pyscf is -75.225640018244 Hartree. For PBE0 the kspy-gga value is -75.2457629977  Hartree and from pyscf  is -75.245762970651 Hartree (libxc:PBE0)- with our convergence criterion of 1e-6.
  
  **<sup>*</sup>** the basis definition with pyscf (nwchem) differs slightly from the basis here (psi4).
